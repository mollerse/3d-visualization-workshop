# 3D visualization workshop

This is a half-day (3 hours) workshop on 3D visualization with webgl using three.js.

## Part 1:

In this part we familiarize ourselves with the three.js API by creating some simple objects and hooking them up with input from the microphone.

Intro material:

- [About 3d visualization](https://holgerl.github.io/3d-visualization-workshop/slides/about-3d-visualization.html)
- [About three.js](https://holgerl.github.io/3d-visualization-workshop/slides/about-threejs.html)

Tasks:

- [Task 1 - Hello cube world!](https://github.com/holgerl/3d-visualization-workshop/tree/master/tasks/task1.md)
- [Task 2 - Animation and sensory input](https://github.com/holgerl/3d-visualization-workshop/tree/master/tasks/task2.md)


## Part 2:

In this part we will look at shaders, what their role are and what they can do. We also look at how we can use shaders in three.js.

Intro material:

- [About shaders](https://holgerl.github.io/3d-visualization-workshop/slides/about-shaders.html)

Tasks:

- [Task 3 - Fragment shaders](https://github.com/holgerl/3d-visualization-workshop/tree/master/tasks/task3.md)
- [Task 4 - Vertex shaders](https://github.com/holgerl/3d-visualization-workshop/tree/master/tasks/task4.md)

## Electives

> NB: None of the electives have been translated to English yet, sorry about that.

In the `electives`-folder you will find additional tasks. These were made for another longer version of this workshop. Should you complete the material and still have time left or simply wish to explore more on your own, feel free to give them a go.

To start an elective:
```sh
npm run elective:[name of elective]
```

To view the solution to an elective:
```sh
npm run solution:[name of elective]

## History

This workshop came together as a 3-part workshop series developed by [@holgerl](https://github.com/holgerl), [@mollerse](https://github.com/mollerse) and [@petteas](https://github.com/petteas) for a Bekk-hosted event for students at NTNU. The original version in Norwegian can be found at [bekk/3d-visualisering-kursserie](http://github.com/bekk/3d-visualisering-kursserie).
